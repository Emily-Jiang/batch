=== Version 2.1

==== Jakarta Batch + CDI integration

As mentioned in the xref:foreword[Foreword], in the 2.1 version of this specification, we make a significant change in both defining the integration of Jakarta Batch + CDI and requiring support for this integration in order to achieve compliance.

=== Version 1.0 Revision A - Maintenance Release

==== Note on archived issues - Jakarta Batch 2.0 Update

The intention here was to track the changes made in the 1.0 Revision A
maintenance release of the JSR 352 Specification, compared to the original
1.0 Final Release.    The original links here refer to the original JSR 352
issues tracker, which is no longer hosted at the original site.

The issues tracker, along with the archived mailing list, is archived in an
IBM-maintained, public GitHub repository.  The relevant info can be found in the
files at path:  https://github.com/WASdev/standards.jsr352.batch-spec/tree/master/java.net.backup .

However, we haven't bothered to extract and re-host the issues in an easily-browsable format, though someone could.  But at this point it hasn't seemed useful enough to prioritize.   So we mention the ids of the original "bugs" in the JSR 352 specification bugzilla originally hosted at java.net, but without working links.

Please contact the Jakarta Batch mailing list with concerns.
